## About me

### Hobbies

- I made a pixel art

![cute pixelart I made](https://github.com/Crow66679/Game/blob/main/Assets/Characters/Ash.png?raw=true)

- most other art I made is painting miniature figures like DnD Characters but I don't have images of those rn
- I've been programming for almost 8 years now and even started working on my own game tho I'm only making very slow progress there
- other than that I mosty spend my time playing videogames like Armored Core, Project Zomboid or Inscryption
- or watching shows with my gf

### History

- Born in the middle of nowhere, Lowe Austria
- moved into progressivley bigger places (for school reasons and job reasons) till I ended up in Vienna
- Worked Fulltime as a Fullstack Java Developer for over a year which for a while sucked all the joy of programming out of me until recently

#### Criminal Past

- nothing anyone can prove in court :3
